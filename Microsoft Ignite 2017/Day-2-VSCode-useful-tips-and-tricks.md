# Tips

## Setup

Insiders edition updated every day.

## Customization with Extensions

Customization is done in the Settings page. The Common settings are all of the settings you are allowed to modify and override.

Install themes - Cobalt2 (by Wes Bos)

Install icon packs - vscode icons

Change user settings (CMD + ,)

Font Ligatures (need to have a font installed that supports it)

Can override based on file types

````
"[json]: {
    "editor.minimap.enabled": false
}"
````


## Keyboard Shortcuts - Key Bindings

Update keybindings (Vim, Atom, etc..)

Keybindings can be updated based upon if/when a situation. ie... F6 to reload window, when not in Debug mode



## Editing and Code Navigation

Use CTRL+R to switch between workspaces

Use CMD+p to quick pick the files you have open.
Use CMD+P with @ sign will show all of the variables

SHITF+DOWN+ALT -- duplicate lines

ALT+DOWN/UP -- moves line up and down

HIGHLIGHT LINES + CMD / -- to comment lines


## Code Styles and Correctness

TypeScript -- TYPE CHECKING -- USE IT

ESLint -- formatting

## Debugging

LAUNCH.json is a very powerful tool. Learn it.

## Tasks

Task is a way to loosely integrate all of existing tools into VSCode.

Can customize tasks and how they run like npm, bower, gulp, etc..

## Integrated Terminal

Change terminal settings via settings file.


## Source Code Control

By default ships git as source-control provider.

Can see diff views side-by-side or inline.

Git-blame / Git-lens (who edited what)


## Extensions

Power Mode (fireworks in the editor)

Git Blame (shows the last commit and contributors)
