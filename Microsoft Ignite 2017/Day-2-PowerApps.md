# PowerApps

Rapidly building web/mobile apps while connecting to data throughout the organization.


### Why should I care about PowerApps?

PowerApps is cross-platform and responsive. 

### Who uses PowerApps in real life, what do they do?

NASCAR uses it for an event management system. Utilizes SharePoint back-end data with a PowerApp built on top of it.

G+J / Pepsi uses it for resource management. They send people to stores for auditing, sales, etc to report back on the general state of the merchandise.

TransAlta uses it for resource management for their wind turbines. They do data analysis to determine what type of resources will be needed to repair turbines in the most efficient way.

PC Mag - "Microsoft PowerApps is a slick, mobile-optimized, and integration-rich low-code development tool."

"A power users dream."

#### Who creates them?

"Makers" on your team, Departmental IT (empowering business to solve problems within departments), Corporate IT, Partners. 

### How easy is it really? Prove it.

Building a PowerApp is as easy as selecting a datasource, and clicking "Build App". Within a couple minutes, you have a functional mobile app right out of the box.

It's a friendly UI for developing. Way less code than building an actual app.
