## What is Native?

UI is Native. When it's a button, it's an actual button.

Native API access - everything you can do in Objective C, Swift, Java.. you have 100% access to the API's. Creates bindings from C# expressions.

## Out of the box

Pages - Content, MasterDetail, Navigation, Tabbed, Carousel

Layouts - Stack, Absolute, Relative, grid, contentview, scrollview, frame

*Tip: Stay away from Carousel page, can probably just use a carousel view*

*Tip: Don't put a list in a scrollview*

Controls - ActivityIndicator, BoxView, Button, DatePicker, Editor, Entry, 

## Progressive Enhancement

Forms Element -> Platform-specific -> Effect -> Custom Renderer
